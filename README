type in the following word to compile QuestionA:
make

B.
result:

[1000]

 sort(): 0 seconds
 v1/v2 are different.
 insertion_sort(): 0.01 seconds
 v1/v2 are the same.

[10000]

 sort(): 0.01 seconds
 v1/v2 are different.
 insertion_sort(): 1.3 seconds
 v1/v2 are the same.

[100000]

 sort(): 0.04 seconds
 v1/v2 are different.
 insertion_sort(): 128.34 seconds
 v1/v2 are the same.

[1000000]

 sort(): 0.52 seconds
 v1/v2 are different.
 insertion_sort(): 10023.34 seconds
 v1/v2 are the same.

explanation:

time complexity of insertion_sort : O(n^2)
time complexity of sort : O(nlogn)
The gap between the time complexity of insertion_sort() and sort() is getting larger as the amount gets larger.
sort() is much faster than insertion_sort().
